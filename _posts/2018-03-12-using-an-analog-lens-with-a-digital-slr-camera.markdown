There are many decent lenses for analog cameras on the market, produced decades ago and still usable today. Some of them could even outperform the ones produced for digital SLR cameras. It's always possible to find a good one with a good price in a flee market nearby. You can find excellent lenses that worth hundreds of Euros for a price under 50 Euros. Especially the ones made for shooting macro photographs.

Some amateur photographers, like me, start photograhpy as a hobby with digital SLRs and want to gain insights about analog photography after some point. [An analog/digital adapter](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/Aluminum-M42-Screw-Lens-to-Canon-M42-EOS-EF-Mount-Adapter-Ring-Rebel-for-canon-XSi/32348973774.html) makes this transition smoother. 

I've used a [Chinon Zoom Macro Multi Coated 85-210mm f/4.5-22](http://m42lens.com/m42-lens-database/1485-chinon-zoom-macro-multi-coated-85-210mm-f-4-5-22) lens with my Canon 550d, when I was taking these pictures:

**Things to know before trying an analog lens on a digital SLR camera**

**What is important when buying an adapter?**
I would recommend buying metal ones. Heavy lenses could break plastic adapters and damage equipments.

**Does autofocus work with analog lenses too?**
No. It won't work with a basic adapter. But there are some gadgets on the market for making this possible: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3binM22uUpg http://techartpro.com

**When to use an analog lens with digital SLR?**
Since it has limitations about autofocus, I would recommend using them when shooting the objects that are not moving. Nevertheless, manual focusing has advantages too, like taking pictures of wild animals in the nature or shooting a celebrity coming out of the entrance of a building.

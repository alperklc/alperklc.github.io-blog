      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I wrote a blog post about anything and did something in the field of game development. Well, this time it started with some game development and it leaded to this blog post.
Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve attended a Global Game Jam event in Hamburg with @Sarge and it was quite fun. (I will write another blog post about Global Game Jams later) It wasn&amp;rsquo;t my first attendance in the Global Game Jam actually.</description>

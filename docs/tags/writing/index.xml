      <description>There are many reasons to write, as I discussed in my previous post. Writing is an essential form of communication, just like speaking. It builds bridges between us, but it&amp;rsquo;s not flawless. We might not be able to transmit every single detail in our minds. Writers are limited with their abilities to use the language while writing what&amp;rsquo;s on their minds. Readers are restricted with their understanding of language and the meanings they give to the words.</description>

Or both; we can create something physical which stimulates thoughts or feelings, gives inspiration to others. I&amp;rsquo;m going to reflect on writing, which can fall into all categories.
In the physical world, we apply pressure on surfaces with a tool such as a pen, to form some signs or letters.</description>

Using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as static site generator.

Notes to future me:

### how to generate pages

- run `hugo` on the root folder. It will generate files in docs folder, since you've set `publicDir` variable to `docs` (see `config.toml`)

### how to develop locally

- `hugo server -D --verbose`

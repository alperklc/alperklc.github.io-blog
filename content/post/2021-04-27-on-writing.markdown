title: It is worth to write
---

Humans like to leave their mark on the world. It can be anything we can see, from buildings to monuments; or it can be something abstract that we can only grasp with our minds. Or both; we can create something physical which stimulates thoughts or feelings, gives inspiration to others. I'm going to reflect on writing, which can fall into all categories.

In the physical world, we apply pressure on surfaces with a tool such as a pen, to form some signs or letters. In the digital world, consumer devices like computers are used, for carving meaningful shapes into the bytes on the storage units. We give meanings to some signs, figures, or letters in both worlds. Counting the physical world as a superset of the digital world enables us to think about sharing information -from cave paintings to tweets- wholistically.

I wonder what was the very first reason humans started doing this. If we have a look at cave paintings, we could imagine the necessity of warning other people around us against dangers outside. If we see Mesopotamian tablets in a museum of archeology we could also have an idea of the origins of writing, like it was initially developed to keep a track of salaries of workers.

In modern times we are writing for other reasons as well. We write for work; organizing our daily life, things like a shopping list before going out for groceries. And of course converting our thoughts, feelings, imaginations, or ideas into words and sentences is also a reason to write. Fiction writing is helping us to imagine traveling somewhere else without moving or looking through the eyes of a person that we've never met. Nonfiction writing helps us to spread the word, teach readers something new and share what we are thinking. Humans are hardwired for connection and sharing of information, we also write in the digital world for communicating with other people. Instant messaging applications help us to stay in contact.

It's possible to think of many possible reasons to create something, from cave paintings to instant messages. But there is one important reason to write; which is in my opinion, the underrated one: -to learn something-. Authoring my own version of what I heard or read helps me to make it permanent in my mind. By expressing something with my own words, I don't only make it easier to remember for myself, I internalize it. It becomes a part of me. Once it becomes a part of me, it helps me to create new things.

I believe our brains are not working like the devices we use for reading this text. I am unable to remember everything I read or hear word by word. If I need to internalize a concept or idea, I need to find patterns and connections between bits of knowledge. For me, it works best if I take notes for myself. This is why I think it is worth writing.

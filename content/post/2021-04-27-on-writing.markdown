title: It is worth to write
---

Humans leave their mark on the world. It can be something physical, like buildings. Or it can be something abstract which we can only grasp with our minds - such as ideas. Or both; it can conduct ideas or thoughts, give inspiration to others through a physical thing. I would like to reflect on writing, which is a nice way to leave a mark on the world.

In the physical world, we apply pressure on surfaces with a tool such as a pen, to form some signs or letters. In the digital world, consumer devices like computers are used, for carving meaningful shapes into the bytes on the storage units. We give meanings to some signs, figures, or letters in both worlds. Counting the physical world as a superset of the digital world enables us to think about sharing information -from cave paintings to tweets- wholistically.

I wonder what was the very first reason humans started doing this. If we have a look at cave paintings, we could imagine the necessity of warning other people around us against dangers outside. If we see Mesopotamian tablets in a museum of archeology we could also have an idea of the origins of writing, like it was initially developed to keep a track of the salaries of workers.

In modern times we are writing for other reasons as well. We write for work; organizing our daily life, things like a shopping list before going out for groceries. And of course converting our thoughts, feelings, imaginations, or ideas into words and sentences is also a reason to write. Fiction writing is helping us to imagine traveling somewhere else without moving, or looking through the eyes of a person that we've never met. Nonfiction writing helps us to spread the word, teach readers something new and share what we are thinking. Humans are hardwired for connection and sharing of information, we also write in the digital world for communicating with other people. Instant messaging applications help us to stay in contact.

It's possible to think of many potential reasons to create, from cave paintings to instant messages. But there is one important reason to create; which is in my opinion, the underrated one: -to learn something and generate ideas-. Authoring my own version of what I heard or read helps me to make it permanent in my mind. By expressing something with my own words, I don't only make it easier to remember for myself, I internalize it. It becomes a part of me.

Once I gain insights into something, I can utilize it to create new things. Generating ideas requires the discovery of patterns and connections between bits of knowledge. For me, it works best if I creatively take notes. Connecting the dots by finding analogies between concepts helps. It makes a lot of fun to write for my future self, just like explaining the subject with those analogies to a friend. This is why I think it is worth writing.

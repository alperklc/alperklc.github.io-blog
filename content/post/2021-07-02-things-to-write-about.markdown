title: Things to write about
---

Creativity is like a muscle, being creative requires exercise. Though it can be hard getting started with exercising creativity, just like getting started with physical activities. Once we get started and see the fruits of our efforts, procrastination wouldn't threaten our progress.

What am I going to write about? Finding ideas can be the hardest part of getting started with writing. As I sat down to write at my first attempt, I had a feeling that my mind was like a jar full of sandy water. It was not clear enough to see through. It was the time I realized that I needed to hold on to a meditative state of mind: Instead of stirring this jar with my desire to write, I had to observe how the sand grains float in water. As I observed how they had been floating, grains of sand started to sink to the bottom. Once the water became clearer, I knew what to do next.

With a clearer mind, I noticed that I wear many hats in everyday life. This gave me a lot of options. As a professional, I could write series of blog posts on many things about my profession. As a lifelong learner, I could gather my notes together on the things I'm learning. I could write a memoir about a part or whole of my life. I could write fictional stories. I could write journals about the things I'm doing every day. All of these options have their own difficulties.

Writing about my profession requires extensive research and structured writing, takes time, and needs patience. Writing a memoir is a really good idea but it might not be possible to remember the details of all early childhood memories. Fictional stories need strong creativity muscles. Having a note-taking habit helps writers in general.

I got inspired by [Jordan Mechner's book](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Jordan-Mechner-ebook/dp/B005WUE6Q2) which is a collection of journals about the making of Prince of Persia. It inspired me to keep a journal. Journaling about daily life is a nice way to get started with writing. You don't have to do research about technical things or make a plan for the future parts of the blog post series. Journal writings do not have to be about professional life. Journaling about our daily feelings would help to regulate our limited and valuable mental energy. Journaling about the business news would help to make decisions on managing the investments.

Journaling helped me to build a note-taking habit. I had kept taking notes until I started to love writing. I hope it leads to series of blog posts and more structured writing in the future.
